# Osu-pp-list
Custom highscorelist for your selected users

osu_highscorelist_api.py is the current file i'm working on. It is still in development.

**You need to register an OAuth application on the osu website
(Account -> Settings -> scroll down -> create new OAuth -> name it (you don't need a callback url). Then you need to create a .env file in your folder with the content "client secret:'yourclientsecret'"**

### To Do:
- save current list (names)
- better gui
- add players (and refresh list)
- delete players from list
- automatically load in save file when starting the program
- right click-functionality (hide / show colums)
- many more...
